Enter [YAKSHA][yaksha], meaning \"demon\" in Sanskrit, my personal automation daimons/daemons for Linux system installation, updation, backups, bash shell scripts, dockerfiles, dotfiles and configuration files to standardize my development environment by automating the installation process and organizing the various developer tools.\r\n\r\n__Standard Disclaimer__ : No warranty and/or guarantee for any particular use, express or implied and you agree to use these [automation daimons][yaksha] at your own risk and liability! \r\n\r\n [yaksha]: http://svaksha.github.io/yaksha \"yaksha\"\r\n\r\n## Installation \r\nTo try out these program scripts & dotfiles, fork this repository, review the code, and remove the things you don’t require.
